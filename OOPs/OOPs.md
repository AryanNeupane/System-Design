## 1. 📜 Early Languages

### 1.1 Machine Language (Binary)

* Direct CPU instructions written in `0s` and `1s`.

#### ❌ Drawbacks:

* Extremely error-prone (one bit flip can break functionality).
* Tedious to write, debug, and maintain.
* No abstraction—every operation must be manually specified.

### 1.2 Assembly Language

* Introduced *mnemonics* (e.g., `MOV A, 61h`) for readability.
* Still tightly coupled to hardware (CPU-specific).

#### 🧱 Scalability Issues:

* Not suitable for building large, maintainable systems.

## 2. ⚙️ Procedural (Structured) Programming

### 🔑 Features Introduced:

* **Functions** for code reuse.
* **Control structures**: `if-else`, `switch`, `for/while` loops.
* **Blocks** to group multiple statements.

### ✅ Advantages:

* Better than assembly: improved **readability**, **modularity**.
* Suitable for **small to medium** size programs.

### ❌ Limitations:

* Poor real-world modeling (can’t represent complex entities easily).
* Global data exposure—no built-in **access control**.
* Limited reusability & extensibility for large systems.

## 3. 🧱 Enter Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

> Model your system as **interacting objects** representing real-world entities.

### ✨ Benefits of OOP:

* **Natural mapping**: `User`, `Car`, `Ride`, etc.
* **Data encapsulation**: Restrict access, protect state.
* **Reusability**: Use inheritance/interfaces to share functionality.
* **Scalability**: Codebase grows in well-structured, modular fashion.

## 4. 🧊 Modeling Real-World Concepts

### Objects, Classes & Instances:

| Term         | Definition                                                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Object**   | A real-world entity with attributes and behaviors                |
| **Class**    | A blueprint defining fields (attributes) and methods (behaviors) |
| **Instance** | A concrete object created from a class                           |

## 5. 🔍 Pillar 1 – Abstraction

> **Abstraction** = Hiding complex internals and showing only what is necessary.

### 5.1 Real-World Analogies

#### 🚗 Driving a Car:

* You use the **steering wheel**, **pedals**, and **key**.
* You don't need to know how **engine timing** or **fuel injection** works.

#### 📺 Using a TV or Laptop:

* You interact via a **remote** or **GUI**.
* Internals like **display refresh rate** or **OS scheduling** are hidden.

### 5.2 Language-Level Abstraction

* High-level constructs (`if`, `for`, `while`) abstract away low-level assembly details.

## 6. 🧑‍💻 Code Abstraction in C++: Abstract Classes & Interfaces

### 6.1 Abstract Class Example

```cpp
// Abstract interface for any Car type
class Car {
public:
    virtual void startEngine() = 0;
    virtual void shiftGear(int newGear) = 0;
    virtual void accelerate() = 0;
    virtual void brake() = 0;
    virtual ~Car() {}
};
```

#### ✅ Key Insights:

* Specifies **what** must be done, not **how**.
* Clients can use `Car*` without knowing the underlying implementation.

### 6.2 Concrete Subclass Example

> Can be added in a separate `code/Car.cpp` file for better structure.

## 7. 🛡️ Benefits of Abstraction

1. Simplifies client interaction with interfaces.
2. Easier to maintain and modify internals without breaking outer code.
3. Enables reuse via interfaces (e.g., `SportsCar`, `ElectricCar`).
4. Reduces complexity in large systems.

---

## 8. 🔐 Pillar 2 – Encapsulation

> **Encapsulation** = Bundling data and methods together, and controlling access to internal state.

### 8.1 Two Key Facets

1. **Logical Grouping**: Fields + Methods live together in one class.

   * Example: `Car` class has `engineOn`, `shiftGear()`, `accelerate()`.

2. **Data Security**: Hide internal state from direct access.

   * Example: You can read a car’s mileage but can’t reset it manually.

### 8.2 Real-World Analogies

* **Medicine Capsule**: Data is hidden inside; you consume via interface.
* **Car Odometer**: You can read it, not reset it manually.

## 9. 🛡️ Access Modifiers in C++

| Modifier    | Access Scope                                    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `public`    | Accessible everywhere                           |
| `private`   | Accessible only within the class                |
| `protected` | Accessible in the class and its derived classes |

### 9.1 Getters & Setters

* Expose limited access to private data with validation.
* Prevent unsafe or invalid changes.

## 10. 💡 Benefits of Encapsulation

1. **Robustness**: Avoids invalid state mutations.
2. **Maintainability**: Safe internal updates without breaking clients.
3. **Clear Contracts**: Defined public API ensures proper usage.
4. **Modularity**: Self-contained components simplify testing and reuse.
